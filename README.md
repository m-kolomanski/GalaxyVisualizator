# GalaxyVisualizator
Application that visualizes various datasets as a traversable galaxy. 

## Todo
- dev basics:
  - use TypeScript, learn!
  - use pixi.js to render graphics?
- visualization functionalities:
  - create file format that is then parsed to create coordinates, sizes and colours of stars in the galaxy
  - allow passing custom callback functions that parse any dataset into desired format, allowing to visualize virtually anything
- gamefy it:
  - allow traversing the galaxy, discovering details about each data point
  - upgrades to the space ship?
- build:
  - build and host on github pages
  - download and parse data in-browser - how exactly?
